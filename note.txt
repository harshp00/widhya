Todays match will depend on recent results in the stadium.
ANALYSIS-
As Head to Head results are-Played 24, MI won 12, DC won 12
so we have to consider recent form of team so-MI at this stadium-Played 5, Won 3, Lost 2 
DC at this stadium - Played 2, Won 0, Lost 2. So, MI has an edge over DC at this stadium 
Basic Analysis has been done in my uploaded file .



According to analysis -
1. Head to Head total 12 matches played , CSK-9 and SRH-3 (using pandas function of DataFrame)
  also at this ground both has played 6 matches each wherein SRH won 4 and CSK won 3.

2.Calculate total CSK and than SRH wides individually for all matches using(.count()) and than cacluate avg by dividing the sum to number of matches 
  we get answer as 7.08 .so approximately 7 wide balls expected. 

3.Calculating the sum of all scores using df['total_runs'] and dividing by no of matches Warner played i.e 6, we get the mean of scores i.e 52.33 (nunique() function of pandas is used here)

4.Using df['dismissal_kind'] we can get total wickets and divide it by no. of matches ,the ans we get is 4.16==4 wickets

5. Using df['total_runs'] will help in getting total runs than divide by no. of matches and we get ans= 344.66 .


According to analysis -
1. Head to Head total 20 matches played , DC-9 and RR-11 (using pandas function of DataFrame)
  BUT at this ground  stats of winning  is  different  DC won 5 and RR won 3.

2. Calc Delhis run in powerplay using using condition (df['overs']<7) and calculating the sum of all total_scores .So the total we get is 953 and dividing it with
    no. of matches we get ans as 47.65. 

3.Calc the sum of all scores of Steve Smith using df['batsman_runs'] and dividing by no of matches Smith played  i.e 2, we get the mean of scores i.e 30.5 (nunique() function of pandas is used here)

4.Calc total  RR  and than DC wides individually for all matches using(.count()) and than cacluate avg by dividing the sum to number of matches 
  we get answer as 6.75 , so approximately 7 wide balls expected.

5.Using  df['dismissal_kind']  for both the teams we can get total wickets for both teams individually  and  than sum AND  further divide it by no. of matches ,the ans we get is 11.25  i.e (11-13) wickets.

5. Using df['total_runs'] will help in getting total runs than divide by no. of matches and we get ans= 344.66 .


According to analysis -
1. Head to Head total 24 matches played , RCB-12 and KXIP -12 (using pandas function of DataFrame)
  BUT at this ground  stats of winning  is  different  RCB won 2 and  won 2.

2.Using df['dismissal_kind'] for KXIP we can get total wickets and divide it by no. of matches to get the average wickets per match ,the ans we get is 5.65== 5 wickets

3.Calc the sum of  scores of Kohli and scores of ABD when batting together also calc how many matches both have played together using df['match_id'].nunique() and scores using df['batsman_runs'] and dividing by no of matches  played  i.e 7, we get the mean of scores i.e 17.142(nunique() function of pandas is used here)

4.Calc total  KXIP  and than RCB sixes individually for all matches using(.count()) and than cacluate avg by dividing the sum to number of matches  we get answer as 12.04 , so approximately 11-14 sixes.

5.Using  (df['noball_runs']==1) we sum for both teams and divide by no of matches, ans is 0.016 == 1


According to analysis -
1. Head to Head total 25 matches played , MI-19 and KKR -6 (using pandas function of DataFrame)
  BUT at this ground  stats of winning  is  different  MI won 4 and KKR won 4.

2.Use df['dismissal_kind'] and df['overs'] >5 anddf['overs']  <17 to get wickets between 5-16 overs and ans is 2.16 approx.

3.Calc total  KKR fours  for all matches using(.count()) and than cacluate avg by dividing the total count  to number of matches  we get answer as 13.16 so approx 13 fours.

4.Rohit sharma against KKR got out maximum times as caught out i.e 7 times and in overall matches 103 times using (.value_counts())

5. Using df['total_runs'] will help in getting total runs than divide by no. of matches and we get ans as 307.4



According to analysis -
1. Head to Head total 21 matches played ,CSK-15  and DC -6 (using pandas function of DataFrame)
  BUT at this ground  stats of winning  is  different  DC won 3 and CSK won 1.

2. Using df['total_runs'] will help in getting total runs than divide by no. of matches and we get average  ans as 163.90  .

3.Use df['dismissal_kind'] and df['overs'] >14 anddf['overs']  <21 to get wickets taken between 15-20 overs and ans is 2.28 approx.


5.Using  (df['noball_runs']==1) we sum for both teams and divide by no of matches, ans is 1.083 == 1


According to analysis -
1. Head to Head total 21 matches played ,CSK-15  and DC -6 (using pandas function of DataFrame)
  BUT at this ground  stats of winning  is  different  DC won 3 and CSK won 1.

2. Using df['total_runs'] will help in getting total runs than divide by no. of matches and we get average  ans as 163.90  .

3.Use df['dismissal_kind'] and df['overs'] >14 anddf['overs']  <21 to get wickets taken between 15-20 overs and ans is 2.28 approx.

4.Use groupby function using aggregate method to get the mean over for CSk scoring 100 runs.

5.Using  (df['noball_runs']==1) we sum for both teams and divide by no of matches, ans is 1.083 == 1



According to analysis -
1. Head to Head total 24 matches played ,MI-13  and KXIP -11 (using pandas function of DataFrame)
  BUT at this ground  stats of winning  is  different  MI played- 4 , won 3 and KXIP played 5 ,  won 2.

2.Using (df[l'batsman'] == 'Q de Kock' ) & df['player_dismissed']=='Q de Kock')  we get  maximum bowlers count as seam bowlers since data was not sufficient for matches against KXIP so overall  matches was taken into account .

3.Use df['dismissal_kind'] and df['overs'] >=1anddf['overs']  <7 to get wickets taken in powerplay and ans is 1.1667 approx.

4.KL Rahul against MI got out maximum (only) time as caught out i.e 2 times and when overall mathces considered  30 times using (.value_counts()) and df['dismissal_kind']

5.Using  df['dismissal_kind']  for both the teams we can get total wickets for both teams individually  and  than sum AND  further divide it by no. of matches ,the ans we get is 12.25  i.e (11-15) wickets.
